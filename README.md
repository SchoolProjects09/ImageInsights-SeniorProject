# ImageInsights:
[Image Insights](https://imageinsights.azurewebsites.net/Gallery) is the web application I created for my senior project. It is an image gallery service that features uploading, dowloading, viewing, and searching images. It also includes account management, such as creating an account, linking uploaded images to your account, and saving a list of favortited images. 

Image Insights was created using ASP.Net MVC (Model-View-Controller) and C# with HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end. The application securely stores data on an SQL database. Featured images were downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
